# TVCFlightCode

Welcome to my Repo for my Thrust Vector Controlled model rocket.\
For my flight computer, I used an Arduino Nano, a BNO055 IMU, a 1528-1462-ND microSD card reader, a MPM3610 buck converter, and a n-channel MOSFET with some resistors.\
Attatched is my flight code, the PCB schematic, and the SolidWorks files.
