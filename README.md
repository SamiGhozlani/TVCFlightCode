# TVCFlightCode

Welcome to my Repo for my Thrust Vector Controlled model rocket.\
For my flight computer, I used an Arduino Nano, a BNO055 IMU, a 1528-1462-ND microSD card reader, and an MPM3610 buck converter among other things (see Pcb schematic for more details).\
Attatched is my flight code, the PCB schematic (developed with Altium), and the SolidWorks files.\
Below is a slow-mo of the first nominal flight.
